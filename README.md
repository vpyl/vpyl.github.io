Digital Fridge Friend

**Problem & Motivation**

People often struggle to decide what to cook with ingredients they already have—especially when considering dietary restrictions, time constraints, or personal preferences. Traditional recipe searches are time-consuming and poorly adapted to individual needs.

**Use Case**

Digital Fridge Friend (DFF) helps users quickly find suitable recipes based on available ingredients, preferences, and goals. It's designed for everyday use to simplify meal planning, reduce food waste, and support healthier, more efficient cooking decisions.

**Why This Project Was Made**

This project explores how intelligent, personalized interfaces can improve everyday tasks. The goal was to design and evaluate a user-friendly system that adapts to diverse needs while maintaining clarity and usability.

**What I Learned**

I learned how to apply user-centered design methods, conduct usability testing, and interpret user feedback. I also gained experience in prototyping, evaluating interface decisions, and iterating designs based on real user behavior and accessibility considerations.
